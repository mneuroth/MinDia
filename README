        Qt Application "MinDia"
========================================================================

This is an application to make multimedia slide shows on a computer.
There is also support to make presentations with rollei projectors.
The following models are supported: "Rolleivision 35 twin digital P"
and "Rolleivision twin msc 3x0 P". 

Have a look to the example files to see some features of the program.

This program is written in C++ with the Qt framework. It runs on GNU/Linux
(tested on SuSE 7.3 and 8.2) and Microsoft-Windows (tested on Windows98 and 
WindowsXP). The Linux-Version prefered by the author, because it has
some more features (fade-in and fade-out of sound-files). 

This application works fine with my dia projector, which is ten years old.
But there is only limited testing done with the newer versions of the 
Rollei-projectors.

========================================================================
The program is released under the GPL, see the file COPYING for details.
